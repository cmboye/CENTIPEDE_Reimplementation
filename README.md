# CENTIPEDE_Reimplementation

This is a re-implementation of the original CENTIPEDE package described here : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044858/.

Our pre-processing was done following the tutorial at https://github.com/slowkow/CENTIPEDE.tutorial. Please also see Preprocessing_prep.sh for our code describing the PWM scan we did, as well as the preparation for the optional conservation data.
